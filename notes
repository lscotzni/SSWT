freestream values: same as outputs from atmosphere group (pressure, temperature, density)

need to incorporate effects of high temperatures on specific heat ratio for 

moment balance from upper/lower pressure, weight

Prandtl-Meyer Function & flow angle to deflection angle relationship for oblique shocks

optimization: force due to pressure difference is equal to the weight of the plate * cos(alpha)

make individual groups for gamma, PM and oblique shocks
    - for gamma group, connect atmosphere.constants into the run file and then have an if statement for 
    temperature dependence
    - for PM and oblique shocks, specify the input Mach number and angles as options and connect in each situation
        i.e. for flat plate, have inputs for above and below for respective values
